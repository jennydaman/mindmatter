answer:
  - The response will have the whitespace trimmed, is not case-sensitive, and must contain this string to be correct
  - This is another answer that is also correct.

# Use 'ans_range' to specify a range of accepted numerical answers
ans_range:
  min: 0
  max: 10
  std: 5 # alternatively, specify error, meaning the answer can be plus of minus error from the actual answer.

# Use 'ans_exact' to specify a correct answer that must be matched exactly, letter-by-letter. 
# answer is case-sensitive, use the '===' JS operator, whitespace is still trimmed
ans_exact: use of this key is not preferred.

prop:
  - math
